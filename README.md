# Local-links-manager

Admin interface for managing Local Authorities links including all their
services and interactions.

This app maps RESTful URLs onto a persistence layer. It doesn't face public
users.

## Nomenclature

- **SNAC** - Standard Names And Code - The old identifier code for locations.
  This is being phased out in favour of GSS codes.
- **GSS**  - Government Statistical Service - The new identifier code for
  locations.
- **LGSL** - Local Government Services List
- **LGIL** - Local Government Interactions List

Both LGSL and LGIL codes are used for the lookups for each Local Authority and
its service interactions.

## Technical documentation

This is a Ruby on Rails app, and should follow [our Rails app
conventions][conventions].

You can use the [GOV.UK Docker environment][govuk-docker] to run the
application and its tests with all the necessary dependencies. Follow the
[usage instructions][docker-usage] to get started.

Running the bare application without any test data isn't very useful, you can
replicate the app's Postgres database [using GOV.UK Docker][replicate-db].

**Use GOV.UK Docker to run any commands that follow.**
