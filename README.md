# Local-links-manager

Admin interface for managing Local Authorities' links including all their services and interactions.

For example, [this service](https://www.gov.uk/garden-waste-disposal) uses Local Links Manager to provide the URL on a Local Authority's website that contains information on disposing of garden waste.

This app maps RESTful URLs onto a persistence layer. It doesn't face public users.

## Nomenclature

- **SNAC** - Standard Names And Code - The old identifier code for locations. This is being phased out in favour of GSS codes.
- **GSS**  - Government Statistical Service - The new identifier code for locations.
- **LGSL** - Local Government Services List
- **LGIL** - Local Government Interactions List

Both LGSL and LGIL codes are used for the lookups for each Local Authority and its service interactions.

## Technical documentation

This is a Ruby on Rails app, and should follow [our Rails app conventions][conventions].

You can use the [GOV.UK Docker environment][govuk-docker] to run the application and its tests with all the necessary dependencies. Follow the [usage instructions][docker-usage] to get started.

Running the bare application without any test data isn't very useful, you can replicate the app's Postgres database [using GOV.UK Docker][replicate-db].

**Use GOV.UK Docker to run any commands that follow.**
